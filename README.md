# Spam-Detection-ML

Spam or junk emails are a fundamental challenge faced both by individuals and businesses. In thisresearch, supervised machine learning models were experimented with the task of detecting spam emails. Our results show that the SVM model is the best model with an accuracy of 98.4%. The integration of support vector machines as a central classification tool enhances the system's ability to discern intricate patterns within emails, contributing to its robust performance. Our research findings validate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in spam filtering and provide valuable insights into the performance of different classifiers. The result contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of machine learning-based spam filtering and offers practical guidance for the development of accurate and efficient spam detection systems.
