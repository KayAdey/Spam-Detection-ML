# 📧 Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Spam emails remain a persistent challenge for individuals and organizations alike. This project explores the use of supervised machine learning techniques to accurately detect and classify spam messages.

## 🧠 Project Overview

We experimented with multiple supervised learning algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in spam detection. Among the models tested, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** delivered the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of **98.4%**.

By leveraging SVM’s ability to identify complex data patterns, the model demonstrated robust classification capabilities. The study confirms the value of machine learning techniques in enhancing email filtering systems and provides comparative insights into the strengths of various classifiers.

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop a spam classification system using supervised ML models
- Compare model performance and select the most accurate
- Provide a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world deployment

## ✅ Key Features

- Preprocessing and vectorization of text data
- Implementation of various ML classifiers (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Clear documentation and reproducibility

## 📊 Results

| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| SVM              | 98.4%    |
